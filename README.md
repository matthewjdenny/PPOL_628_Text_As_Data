# PPOL 628: Text As Data

NOTE THAT THIS REPO IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. This github repo will serve as the course webpage for PPOL 628 for Spring 2021. I am using this platform as it will make it easier to share materials with auditors and students from other universities.
